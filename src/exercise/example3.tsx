/**
 * ============================================================================
 * Exercise 3 - Deployment Queue
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Scenario
 * --------
 *
 * Congratulations!
 *
 * The DeploymentCard component and search functionality have been completed.
 *
 * Your next task is to build the Deployment Queue page by integrating the
 * previous exercises.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Requirements
 *
 * Build a Deployment Queue page using the supplied mock API response.
 *
 * The page should display all deployments using the DeploymentCard component
 * created in Exercise 1.
 *
 * Use the custom hook created in Exercise 2 for searching deployments.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Functional Requirements
 *
 * 1. Fetch deployments using React Query.
 *
 * 2. Display all deployments.
 *
 * 3. Search deployments by Application Name.
 *
 * 4. Display the following summary:
 *
 *      Total Deployments
 *
 * 5. Add a Status filter.
 *
 *      All
 *      Pending
 *      In Progress
 *      Completed
 *      Failed
 *
 * 6. Display an Empty State when no deployments match the search/filter.
 *
 * 7. Display a Loading State while data is loading.
 *
 * 8. Display an Error State when the request fails.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Technical Expectations
 *
 * • React Query
 *
 * • TypeScript
 *
 * • Reusable Components
 *
 * • Clean Folder Structure
 *
 * • Avoid duplicated logic
 *
 * • Use the custom hook from Exercise 2
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Bonus (Optional)
 *
 * If time permits, implement one or more of the following:
 *
 * • Sort deployments by Scheduled Date
 *
 * • Display deployment counts grouped by Status
 *
 * • Display the number of filtered deployments
 *
 * • Highlight the matched search text
 *
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * • You may create additional components if needed.
 *
 * • You may extend the custom hook created in Exercise 2.
 *
 * • Focus on clean architecture over visual appearance.
 *
 * ============================================================================

 *
 * ✓ React
 * ✓ React Query
 * ✓ TypeScript
 * ✓ Component Composition
 * ✓ Hooks
 * ✓ State Management
 * ✓ Code Organization
 * ✓ Reusability
 * ✓ Tailwind CSS
